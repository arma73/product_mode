 * Public url of the app configurable using environment variable, which can be
 * installed before starting Node.js express server. If you want to host 
 * your website in a relative part other than the server root, it is possible to specify 
 * the base URL either through the homepage key inside yours package.json or via 
 * PUBLIC_URL environment variable, which must be set before building the project.
 * When you run react-scripts build script %PUBLIC_URL%, placeholders inside index.html
 * file are replaced with environment variable string. In case we want to serve our
 * application under a different public URL, for example https://my-site.com/app,
 * we can build the project like this:
 * @example PUBLIC_URL = https://my-site.com/app yarn build:prod
 * @param {string} appPackageJSON
 * 
 * @returns {string}
